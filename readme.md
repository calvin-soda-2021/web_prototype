# Web-Prototype for MQTT Data Transfer
This simple webpage is designed to test the MQTT data transfer feature of the Soda-Pop project.  
Currently it is hard coded to subscribe to the "calvin-soda-pop" channel on "broker.mqttdashboard.com" using the Ecclipse Paho JavaScript library.  
The library documentation was found here: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/using-javascript-mqtt-client-websockets/
